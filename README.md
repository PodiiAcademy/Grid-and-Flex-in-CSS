## Layout Demo 

### Comparison of CSS Flexbox and CSS Grid

Code is not 100% clean, intention was to compare the experience of building HTML Layout with these two different Tools.

### Conclusion

* CSS Grid let you build 2-dimensional Layouts
* The Structure is build with managing an Element Structure in HTML if you use Flexbox
* CSS can be a lot faster when using Grid-Areas
* Grids should be used for global Structuring
* Aligning Items in a Container is probably done faster with Flexbox
